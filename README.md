# Analog_electronics

This is one of the most dedicated projects which i am doing for my betterment.
This is the 50 day project which is starting from August 15, 2024
In this project, i will take all of the possible analog microelectronic circuits and simulate it using LTSPICE
After simulation, i will upload the same in the github with the actual file of the LTSPICE and also the documentation of the circuit simulated.

Thanks for your time.... have a great day.
